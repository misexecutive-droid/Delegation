 *
 * Dragging a ticket used to call the plain update endpoint with `{ status }` and nothing else —
 * so a board move changed the status but wrote no TicketStatusUpdate row and asked for no remark,
 * while the exact same move made from the detail sheet did both. The ticket's own history was
 * missing every drag. This routes drags through the same remark-gated endpoint the sheet uses.
 *
 * Mirrors tasks/useTaskStatusMove.tsx, including returning the dialog as a node so a caller can't
 * render the move UI and forget the gate.
