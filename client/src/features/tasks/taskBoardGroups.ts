 * a status column means "change its status", which is a real, reversible, audited action the

 * dropping a card on a department column would have to mean "reassign this to that department",
 * which is a different decision with different consequences, so those boards don't accept drops.
 * The card's own status menu still works in every grouping, so nothing is unreachable.
