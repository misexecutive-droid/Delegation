 * Tasks and Tickets each had their own copy of this — identical logic (bail on no note, approved
 * vs sent-back, same two labels, same two icons) with different styling: the task version was
 * `p-3 rounded-xl text-xs` with a bare 14px icon, the ticket version `p-4 rounded-2xl text-sm`
 * with the icon in a tinted tile. Same message, two visual weights, depending on which detail
 * panel you happened to open. This is the ticket treatment, which was the more legible of the two.
