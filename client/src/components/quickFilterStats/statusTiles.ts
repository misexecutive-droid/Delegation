/**
 * The one definition of the quick-filter stat tiles.
 *
 * Five modules each declared their own `TILES` array — Delegation, Tickets, To-Do, My Checklists
 * and the Compliance board — describing the same handful of status buckets. They had drifted:
 * "Completed" carried `bg-success/10 border-success/50` on two pages and `bg-success/15
 * border-success/40` on three, and the same "past due" bucket was labelled "Delayed" on some pages
 * and "Overdue" on others. Every one of those arrays also carried `icon`, `tint` and `accentRing`
 * values that QuickFilterStats never reads, so a lot of that carefully-maintained config rendered
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * Modules now say *which* buckets they show and what to call them; how a bucket looks is decided
 * here, once.
