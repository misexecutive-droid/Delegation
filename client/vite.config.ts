         * Everything the app shell touches used to land in a single `components-*.js` that the
         * entry HTML preloads — so one changed line in `src/components` invalidated 193 kB of
         * gzipped React Router, Radix, framer-motion and Zod for every returning user. These
         * libraries change on their own (slow) schedule; our code changes daily. Separate files
         * means a redeploy only busts the app chunk (now ~49 kB gzip).
         *
         * NAMING A CHUNK IS NOT FREE. A named chunk gets hoisted to wherever its members are
         * reachable from, which can promote a lazy library into an entry dependency. Two of these
         * bit during this change: a `vendor-charts` rule put 113 kB gzip of recharts in front of
         * first paint for people who never open a chart, and a `vendor-motion` rule pulled React
         * itself in alongside framer-motion, so every other chunk imported it just to get React.
         * Both are now unlisted and ship with whatever lazily imports them. Only add a rule here
         * for something the entry genuinely needs, and re-measure the entry after adding it.
