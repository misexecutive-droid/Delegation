// way Mongoose's connection pool did for MongoDB. mysql2 pools are lazy (no actual
// TCP connection is opened until the first query/`getConnection()` call), so it's
// safe to create the pool — and the Drizzle client wrapping it — at module load
// time; `connectDB()` below just does an explicit "fail fast if unreachable" check
// before the server starts accepting requests.

// The Drizzle client used everywhere else in the app (`import { db } from '../config/db.js'`).
// Exported as `db` (not `mongoose`/a model) — every service module now imports this
// instead of a Mongoose model. Declared as a plain `const` (type fully inferred) rather
// than a pre-typed `let` assigned later — an explicit `ReturnType<typeof drizzle<...>>`
// annotation here runs into a TS2719 "two different types with this name" quirk against
// this drizzle-orm version when the schema+relations modules are merged at the call site.
