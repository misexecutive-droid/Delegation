// This is a "router factory": a function that BUILDS and returns an Express Router,

//
// Why does this exist? Many parts of this app have simple "lookup" data - small reference
// lists like Store (currently the only real consumer — Department/Category grew their own
// full controllers instead) - that all need basically the exact same CRUD (Create, Read,
// Update, Delete) API: list them all, add a new one, edit one, delete one. Rather than
// copy-pasting nearly identical route code, we write the logic ONCE here as a generic
// function, and any lookup table just calls `createLookupRouter(someTable)`.
//
// Migrated from a Mongoose `Model<any>` to a Drizzle table generic. Every lookup table is
// expected to have `id` and `name` columns (that's all this factory ever touches) — Drizzle
// doesn't have a shared "every table" base type the way Mongoose's `Model` did, so we
// constrain the generic to just those two required columns via an intersection type.

// passes neither and must keep getting the full list back, unchanged.
