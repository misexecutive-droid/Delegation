// callers that need a "just my own records" fallback (e.g. task compliance for AGENT/USER)
// handle that separately, since it isn't a department/store concept.
//
// Note: a report whose model has no departmentId (or no storeId) field just won't have that key
// read off the returned object by its caller, so e.g. a SENIOR resolves to a store scope here but
// a caller that only destructures `departmentId` (task compliance) naturally falls back to
// org-wide for them — same for MANAGER on a store-only report like checklist compliance.

// (it has no storeId), so we resolve every department in their store instead; a MANAGER
// (department-scoped) can't filter ChecklistInstance directly (it has no department concept),
// so we resolve their department's home store instead. Both degrade to their prior org-wide
// behavior when the relevant department has no store assigned yet.
