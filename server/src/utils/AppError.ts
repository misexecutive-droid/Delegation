// A custom error class for "expected" errors we throw on purpose (like "not found" or "bad request").
// Why not just `throw new Error("...")` or even `throw "some string"`?
// Because a plain Error/string doesn't carry an HTTP status code, so whatever catches it
// (usually a global error-handling middleware in Express) wouldn't know whether to send
// back a 400, 404, 409, etc. By extending Error and attaching a statusCode, every route
// handler can just `throw AppError.notFound(...)` and the error middleware can read
// `err.statusCode` to build the right HTTP response automatically.

        // that get compiled down to older JS targets: without this line, `instanceof AppError`

        // is correctly set to AppError, so `instanceof` works as expected.

        // Node.js-specific helper: if available, this trims the constructor itself out of the
        // stack trace, so the stack trace starts from wherever AppError was actually thrown,
        // instead of pointing here inside the AppError class. Makes debugging easier.

    // Below are convenience "factory" methods for the most common HTTP error types.
    // Why have these instead of writing `new AppError("...", 400)` everywhere?
    // - It's shorter and more readable at the call site: `AppError.notFound("User")`
    //   instantly tells you what's happening, versus remembering "404 means not found".
    // - It centralizes the mapping between meaning ("this is a conflict") and the actual
    //   HTTP status code (409), so if conventions ever change, you only update it in one place.

    // 403 Forbidden - the user is authenticated but not allowed to do this action.
    static forbidden(message = 'Forbidden') { return new AppError(message, 403); }
    // 404 Not Found - the requested resource (e.g. a document by id) doesn't exist.
    static notFound(message = 'Not found') { return new AppError(message, 404); }
    // 409 Conflict - the request conflicts with existing data (e.g. duplicate name/email).
    static conflict(message: string) { return new AppError(message, 409); }
